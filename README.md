# Final Project 
## Data Visualization Class

For our Final Project we had to create a Shiny App dashboard and a Tableau dashboard.

The shiny app must had plotly, animations, widgets, etc... to display the findings of a machine learning project.

We must build a:

Neural Network
Deep Learning Neural Network
Random Forest
SVM
AutoML model

To classify something and present the resulting data, visualizations, and metrics (accuracy, significant difference tests, etc).

The dashboard should not run the model, just present the results. The tableau dashboard should present the same data.
